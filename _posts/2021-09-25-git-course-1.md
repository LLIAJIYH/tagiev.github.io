## What is Git and why is it used?

Git is a command line utility for tracking and maintaining the change history of files in your project. Most often it is used for code, but it can be used for other files as well.
The version control system helps developers in introducing large projects to improve the productivity of their work. Let's look at an example of using Git version control.

We have a program that the development team is developing together. To make it easier to work with different versions and changes of the program, they use Github to store data. There is a main branch, where the main program code is stored, which went through the stages of creation, testing, catching bugs, etc. New changes are added to the feature branch so as not to break the source code from the main branch. Further, after all the checks, a "release" is created, that is, the release of a new version of the program, with verified changes. But unexpectedly, the developers found a previously unknown bug that urgently needs to be fixed. They will write the changes related to this error to the hotfix branch and then transfer them as a new "sub-version" of the program.
And this is just a small part of how you can simplify development over a repository. Intrigued? Then let's start by learning how to work with git.

## A bit of theory

A repository is the repository of your code and the history of its changes. Git runs locally and all of your repositories are stored in specific folders on your hard drive.
Each savepoint in your project is called a commit. Each commit has a hash (unique id) and a comment. A branch is built from such commits. A branch is a history of changes. Each branch has its own name. A repository can contain several branches that are created from or merged into other branches.
Head we will call the current position relative to the entire tree of branches. That is, we, moving from commit to commit, from branch to branch, change the position of our head.

## Git commit

A commit in the git repository writes a snapshot of all (tracked) files in your directory. It looks like a giant copy and paste, but even better!
Git wants to keep commits as light as possible, so it doesn't just blindly copy the entire directory every time you commit. It can (when possible) compress the commit as a changeset or "delta" from one version of the repository to the next.
Git also maintains a history of when and when commits were made. This is why there are ancestor commits above most commits - we denote this with arrows in our visualization.
Keeping history is great for everyone working on a project! This is difficult to understand, but for now you can think of commits as snapshots of the project. The commits are very lightweight and switching between them is super easy!
Let's look at an example, we have a main branch and two commits , then we create a new commit using the command

![commit 1](https://i.imgur.com/L2EbAoW.png)

`git commit` and the main branch is shifted to it (since we are now making commits to the main branch)

![commit 2](https://i.imgur.com/5qd1DvT.png)

Simple enough example, but how do you switch between commits? To do this, remember that our current position is our head (HEAD). Now let's try to move to commit C1. To do this, enter the command `git checkout C1`. In your case, the name of the commit will be the first couple of hash characters, which we talked about a little above.

You can also navigate to a specific branch. To do this, enter the command `git checkout main` (the branch name may differ, since you may have a different structure).
